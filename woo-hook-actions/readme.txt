== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Custom Field Widget displays the custom field values of a specified custom field key in your sidebar.

= I have no idea what your answer means. =

That's fine. Read the *Use* section for more information on using custom fields and possible applications of this plugin.

= Fine. Can you give me one example of what I could do with this plugin? =

You could use it to display a graphic in the sidebar that you set on a per-post and/or per-page basis. Say you want certain posts/pages to include a graphic that aren't necessarily categorized together. Create a custom field with a common key and this widget will display the corresponding values in the sidebar.

= That's pretty slick. Give me another example. =

No. See the *Use* section and let your imagination run wild.

= I'd like to modify this plugin in some way unavailable through the widget options panel. Will you help me? =

No. I apologize as I am unable to help with modifications with any of my plugins.

= Well, thanks for nothing. =

Not even thanks for the plugin?
